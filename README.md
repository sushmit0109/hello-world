# hello-world
A desolate garden
Where the slaves exist to assist
And to merge with the master when they are complete
The ancient monotheistic religion manifests itself again
In this wreched graveyard of GITHUB.

I am here just trying to do some artificial neural network based image processing
To make myself forget the existential dread 
The quotidian emptiness that fills my heart with void.
